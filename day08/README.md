The API was chosen since it was noticed was noticed as an open tab in the explanation video. You can use whatever API you like, but the code would need to accommodate that data structure.

After creating a free account, or an paid one if you so choose, just copy the `env.example` file to `.env` and put in 'YOUR' values.
